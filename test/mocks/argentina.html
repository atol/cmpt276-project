<h2>Official Global Travel Advisories</h2>
<p><strong>Avoid non-essential travel outside of Canada and <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/latest-travel-health-advice.html#cruise">avoid all cruise ship travel outside Canada</a> until further notice.</strong></p>
<p>Many countries continue to have strict travel restrictions in place, and the availability of options for international transportation remain limited. As a result you may have difficulty returning to Canada. While some countries are partially opening their borders, we continue to advise <a href="/travelling/advisories/faq">against non-essential travel</a> outside of Canada. We also continue to advise that you <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/latest-travel-health-advice.html#cruise">avoid all cruise ship travel</a> outside Canada until further notice. </p>
<p>The governments of those destinations that have opened their borders to tourists could impose strict travel restrictions suddenly, should they experience an increase in cases of COVID-19. International transportation options could be reduced significantly, making it difficult for you to return to Canada.  There are no plans to offer additional repatriation flights.  Should you decide to travel despite our advisories, know that you might have to remain abroad longer than you expected.</p>
<p>If you choose to travel despite these advisories:
<ul>
<li>you may have difficulty obtaining essential products and services</li>
<li>you may suddenly face strict movement restrictions and quarantines at designated facilities and at your own cost</li>
<li>your <a href="/travelling/documents/travel-insurance">insurance</a> may not cover your travel or medical expenses</li>
<li>we may have limited capacity to offer you consular services.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>If you are currently outside Canada or you are returning home, see <a href="/travelling/health-safety/covid-19-security">COVID-19 safety and security advice for Canadians abroad</a>.</p>

Common scams include:</p><ul><li>spraying a substance on victims and then robbing them while pretending to help clean the stain</li><li>distracting the victim by asking questions while another person perpetrates the theft</li></ul><p>In some cases, thieves on foot work with thieves on motorcycles, &ldquo;motochorros,&rdquo; to snatch purses and backpacks.</p><ul><li>Avoid wearing expensive watches or jewellery or showing signs of affluence</li><li>Ensure that your personal belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times</li><li>Do not hang bags and purses on chairs in public places</li><li>Carry a photocopy of your passport for identification purposes and leave the originals in your hotel safe</li><li>Do not carry large amounts of money</li><li>Remain aware of your surroundings when using ATMs and avoid using them at night</li><li>Avoid packing valuables in checked luggage because organized groups are known to operate at airports searching for electronics and valuables</li></ul><p>Armed robberies and muggings occur in urban centres. While most victims are not physically injured, criminals <span lang="EN-US">may use violence</span> if opposed. If robbed, hand over your cash and valuables without resistance.</p><p>Avoid walking alone after dark, especially in the downtown areas of major cities.</p><p>If you are a victim of a crime, inform the police and get a police report. It is not possible to file a police report from abroad or for the Canadian embassy to do it on your behalf.</p><h3>Buenos Aires</h3><p>In Buenos Aires, be cautious in all tourist areas, particularly in:</p><ul><li>La Boca</li><li>Congreso</li><li>Florida Street</li><li>the Retiro bus station area</li><li>San Telmo</li></ul><p>In La Boca, always remain on Caminito Street.

Belongings are stolen from the trunk of parked cars.</p><h3>Kidnapping</h3><p>Though not common, express kidnappings involving tourists have occurred in Argentina. Victims are usually abducted for a few hours and forced to withdraw money from ATMs in order to be released.</p><h3>Tri-border area</h3><p>When travelling to Iguaz&uacute; Falls, exercise caution when crossing the tri-border area between Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay, where criminal activities are known to occur.</p><p>Avoid crossing these borders in local taxis or buses after dark.</p><h3>Demonstrations</h3><p>Demonstrations, roadblocks and strikes may occur throughout the country at any time.</p><p>Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time.

If you are arriving at Ezeiza, go to an established remise stand in the arrivals area.</p><p>Call radio-taxis instead of hailing taxis on the street, particularly in Buenos Aires. If hailing a taxi, ensure that it is marked &ldquo;radio-taxi&rdquo; and that the company&rsquo;s name and telephone number are clearly visible.</p><p>Do not share taxis with strangers. Carry small bills to pay for taxi fares. Unscrupulous taxi drivers sometimes trade counterfeit bills for good ones.</p><p>There have been several accidents resulting in deaths and injuries involving intercity trains connecting with Buenos Aires.</p><!-- START Road safety --><h3>Road safety</h3><p>Pedestrians, cyclists and drivers should exercise extreme caution in Argentina, as it has one of the highest traffic accident rates in the world. Many drivers ignore traffic lights and speed limits.</p><p>Be particularly vigilant when stopped at traffic lights.
